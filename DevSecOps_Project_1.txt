Capstone Project: Real-World Use Case

Project Title: E-Commerce Inventory Management System

Project Description:

In this capstone project, students will develop an E-Commerce Inventory Management System, a Java-based web application, which will manage products, inventory, and orders for a fictional e-commerce platform. 
The application will be built using Maven and deployed on an Apache Tomcat server. 

The goal is to provide an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that integrates code quality checks, artifact management, and automated deployments, along with application monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.

Business Scenario:

You are a DevOps engineer for an e-commerce company that needs an inventory management system to help keep track of products, monitor stock levels, and process orders efficiently. 

The system is crucial for the business to keep operations running smoothly and to provide real-time inventory updates on the e-commerce platform. 

Your task is to set up a CI/CD pipeline that ensures high-quality code, fast delivery of new features, and reliable operation of the application.

Project Requirements:

	1.	Java Web Application:
	•	Develop a simple Java-based web application using Spring Boot.
	•	The application should have basic functionalities:
	  •	 Add new products to the inventory.
	  •	Update stock levels.
	  •	View product details and stock levels.
	  •	Process orders and update inventory accordingly.
	•	Use Maven for project management and building the application.
	
 2.	Version Control:
	  •	Use Git for version control and host the repository on GitHub.
	
 3.	CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins:
	  •	Continuous Integration (CI):
	  •	Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build process using Maven.
	  •	Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis. Ensure the pipeline stops and alerts if any critical code quality issues are found.
	  •	Continuous Deployment (CD):
	  •	Use JFrog Artifactory to manage build artifacts. Store versioned JAR/WAR files.
	  •	Deploy the application to an Apache Tomcat server automatically after passing all quality gates.
	
 4.	SonarQube:
	  •	Perform code quality checks using SonarQube.
	  •	Set up a quality gate to fail the build if there are any critical bugs, code smells, or security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.

5.	JFrog Artifactory:
	  •	Store Maven build artifacts (JAR/WAR) in JFrog Artifactory.
	  •	Manage versions and dependencies of the application artifacts.
 
6.	Apache Tomcat:
	  •	Deploy the application to Apache Tomcat automatically from the CI/CD pipeline.
	  •	Ensure zero-downtime deployments.
	 
7.	AWS CloudWatch Monitoring:
	  •	Monitor application health and performance using AWS CloudWatch.
	  •	Set up heartbeat monitoring to ensure the application is running and responding as expected.
	  •	Configure alarms to alert the team if the application goes down or if performance metrics cross defined thresholds.

Detailed Steps:

	1.	Project Setup:
	  •	Initialize the project with Spring Boot and create a basic structure for the Inventory Management System.
	  •	Push the project to a GitHub repository.
	2.	Pipeline Setup in Jenkins:
	  •	Install Jenkins and necessary plugins (Git, Maven, SonarQube Scanner, Artifactory, CloudWatch).
	  •	Configure Jenkins to pull code from the GitHub repository.
	  •	Write Jenkinsfile (both scripted and declarative) to define the CI/CD pipeline.
	  •	Stages in Jenkinsfile:
	  •	Checkout code from GitHub.
	  •	Build the application using Maven.
	  •	Run SonarQube analysis to check code quality.
	  •	If SonarQube quality gate passes, upload the artifact to JFrog Artifactory.
	  •	Deploy the application to Apache Tomcat.
	  •	Set up AWS CloudWatch for application monitoring.
	3.	Implementing Conditional Deployment:
	  •	Use Jenkins conditional steps to ensure deployment to Tomcat only occurs if the code passes SonarQube checks.
	4.	Testing and Validation:
	  •	Test the application locally and in the deployed environment.
	  •	Validate the pipeline by introducing deliberate code quality issues and observing how the pipeline reacts.
	5.	Monitoring Setup:
	  •	Configure AWS CloudWatch agent on the Tomcat server.
	  •	Create CloudWatch dashboards to monitor application metrics like CPU usage, memory, response time, and custom heartbeat metrics.

Learning Outcomes:

	•	End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline: Understanding the setup and management of a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java web application.
	•	Code Quality and Security: Learning the importance of code quality checks and how tools like SonarQube can be integrated into CI pipelines.
	•	Artifact Management: Using JFrog Artifactory for efficient artifact management and understanding the significance of version control in deployments.
	•	Deployment Automation: Automating the deployment process using Jenkins and Apache Tomcat, ensuring reliable and consistent application delivery.
	•	Monitoring and Observability: Gaining insights into application health and performance monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, setting up alarms, and maintaining system uptime.

This capstone project simulates a real-world scenario that DevOps engineers often face, providing hands-on experience with tools and practices crucial for modern software development and operations.
